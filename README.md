# Stick Figure Badminton
UIUC 21FA ECE385 final project, the whole project is done by myself. 

Some software files are missing, but you can simply modify the code from lab, I didn't done many modification for software part.

Basically, all code is written in verilog, except the part for keyboard. So the final outlook is really simple.
